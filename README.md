Convert content from PDF bank statements into usable data formats.

This project aims to use specifically configured regexs mostly to strip desired data from a bunch of text.

The "bunch of text", in my use case, will be copy and pasted from PDF bank statement files. This software will aim to convert the pasted text into usable data formats. (CSV, SQLite3, others?)

It is written in PHP and will run on the command line.
